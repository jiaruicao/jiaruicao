I have also worked as a Data Scientist in a FinTech company before, where I have built the end-to-end machine learning systems for credit decision models. 

#### Community Organiser

I am actively involved in different AI/ML communities in London. 


I am organising <img src="https://pydata.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pydata-logo-final.png" height="25" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="PyData logo"> [London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-london-meetup/). You can submit your talk at this [link](https://london.pydata.org/submit-a-talk/).

I am also volunteering at the annual <img src="https://pydata.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pydata-logo-final.png" height="25" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="PyData logo"> [London Conference](https://pydata.org/london2025/home). 

I am also part of these communities:

- [Warwick Finance Professional Network (WFPN)](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/2098432/) 

#### Blogs 
I write things in 

- My [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaruicao/), for short ideas/notes. 
- My [personal website](https://jiaruicao.github.io/), for longer blogs. 


#### Open Source

From various envents from [PyData](https://pydata.org/) and [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/), I am deeply attracted by and involved in the open source community and making my initial steps to contribute to them. Check my github contributions in this page. ðŸ˜„

#### Educational Background 

Back in 2016, I finished my PhD in [Mathsmatics at Warwick University](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/). My supervisor were [Stefan Grosskinsky](https://stefangrosskinsky.com/) and [Paul Chleboun](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/chleboun/). 

My reaserch was in the area of complex systems. Where I have investigated certain types of interacting particle systems. You can find my thesis [here](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/77674/). 

I also have a master in Financial Maths and an undergraduate in statistics. So, I was pretty much trained as a mathematician.
