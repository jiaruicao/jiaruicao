#### Educational Background 

Back in 2016, I finished my PhD in [Mathsmatics at Warwick University](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/). My supervisor were [Stefan Grosskinsky](https://stefangrosskinsky.com/) and [Paul Chleboun](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/chleboun/). 

My reaserch was in the area of complex systems. Where I have investigated certain types of interacting particle systems. You can find my thesis here. 

I also has a M.Sc in Financial Maths and a B.Sc in statistics. So, I was pretty much trained as a mathematician.
